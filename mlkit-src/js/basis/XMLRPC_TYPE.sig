[int] type <int> and <i4>.

[bool] type <boolean>.

[real] type <double>.

[string] type <string>.

[date] type <dateTime.iso8601>.

[unit] type <int> with value 0.

[pair] type <array> where type 'a is type of member with index 0 and
'b is type of member with index 1.

[tup3] type <array> where type 'a is type of member with index 0, 'b 
is type of member with index 1, and 'c is type of member with index 2.

[tup4] type <array> where type 'a is type of member with index 0, 'b 
is type of member with index 1, 'c is type of member with index 2,
and 'd is type of member with index 3.

[option] type <array> with either one element or zero elements.

[list] type <array>. Homogeneous lists where elements must be of
identical type.

[array] type <array>. Homogeneous arrays where elements must be of
identical type.

[vector] type <array>. Homogeneous vectors where elements must be of
identical type.

[option] type <array> with zero or one element.

[conv (f,g) a] allows for constructing a serializer of arbitrary
type, given an empedding-projection pair (f,g) into the type a.
