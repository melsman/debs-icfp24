signature SPLAYTREE =
  sig
    datatype 'a splay = 
	SplayObj of { value : 'a, right : 'a splay, left  : 'a splay }
      | SplayNil

    val splay : ('a -> order) * 'a splay -> order * 'a splay
    val join  : 'a splay * 'a splay -> 'a splay
  end

(* 
   [splay (cmp,tree)] returns (r,tree') 
   where tree' is tree adjusted using the comparison function cmp
   and, if tree' = SplayObj{value,...}, then r = cmp value.
   It holds that tree' = SplayNil iff tree = SplayNil, in which case 
   r is undefined.

   [join(t,t')] returns a new splay tree formed of t and t'
