(*
 [cache] abstract type of cache.

 [createTm (n, t)] creates a cache, given a cache name n and
 a cache timeout value t in seconds.

 [createSz (n, sz)] creates a cache, given a cache name n 
 and a maximum cache size sz in bytes.

 [find n] returns a cache, given a cache name n. Returns 
 NONE if no cache with the given name exists.

 [findTm (cn,t)] as find, except that the cache with name cn 
 is created if it does not already exist. If the cache is 
 created then t is used as cache timeout value in seconds.

 [findSz (cn,s)] as find, except that the cache with name cn 
 is created if it does not already exist. If the cache is 
 created then s is used as cache size in bytes.

 [flush c] deletes all entries in cache c.

 [set (c,k,v,t)] associates a key k with a value v in the 
 cache c with timeout t; overwrites existing entry in cache 
 if k is present, in which case the function returns false. 
 If no previous entry for the key is present in the cache, 
 the function returns true. If t is 0 then the default timeout 
 is used.

 [get (c,k)] returns value associated with key k in cache c; 
 returns NONE if key is not in cache.

 [cacheForAwhile (f,cn,t)] where f is a function, cn is a 
 cache name, and t a cache timeout value in seconds. Returns
 a new function f' equal to f except that its results are 
 cached and only recalculated when the cached results are 
 older than the timeout value. This function can be used, for 
 instance, to cache fetched HTML pages from the Internet. The 
 timestamp is not renewed when items are accessed.

 [cacheWhileUsed (f,cn,t)] as casheForAwhile, except that 
 the timestamp is renewed at each access. An item is removed 
 from the cache if t seconds have passed after the last 
 access.
