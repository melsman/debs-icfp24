= Globalize

<<Globalize#>> is an analysis pass for the <<SXML#>>
<<IntermediateLanguage#>>, invoked from <<ClosureConvert#>>.

== Description

This pass marks values that are constant, allowing <<ClosureConvert#>>
to move them out to the top level so they are only evaluated once and
do not appear in closures.
