= RSSASimplify

The optimization passes for the <<RSSA#>> <<IntermediateLanguage#>> are
collected and controlled by the `Backend` functor
(https://github.com/MLton/mlton/blob/master/mlton/backend/backend.sig[`backend.sig`],
https://github.com/MLton/mlton/blob/master/mlton/backend/backend.fun[`backend.fun`]).

The following optimization pass is implemented:

* <<BounceVars#>>
* <<CollectStatics#>>
* <<RSSAShrink#>>

The following implementation passes are implemented:

* <<ImplementHandlers#>>
* <<ImplementProfiling#>>
* <<InsertLimitChecks#>>
* <<InsertSignalChecks#>>

The optimization passes can be controlled from the command-line by the options

* `-diag-pass <pass>` -- keep diagnostic info for pass
* `-disable-pass <pass>` -- skip optimization pass (if normally performed)
* `-enable-pass <pass>` -- perform optimization pass (if normally skipped)
* `-keep-pass <pass>` -- keep the results of pass
