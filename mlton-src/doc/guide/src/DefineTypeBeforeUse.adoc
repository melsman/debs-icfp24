= DefineTypeBeforeUse

<<StandardML#,Standard ML>> requires types to be defined before they are
used.  Because of type inference, the use of a type can be implicit;
hence, this requirement is more subtle than it might appear.  For
example, the following program is not type correct, because the type
of `r` is `t option ref`, but `t` is defined after `r`.

val r = ref NONE
datatype t = A | B
val () = r := SOME A

MLton reports the following error, indicating that the type defined on
line 2 is used on line 1.

While the above example is benign, the following example shows how to
cast an integer to a function by (implicitly) using a type before it
is defined.  In the example, the ref cell `r` is of type
`t option ref`, where `t` is defined _after_ `r`, as a parameter to
functor `F`.

val r = ref NONE
functor F (type t
           val x: t) =
   struct
      val () = r := SOME x
      fun get () = valOf (!r)
   end
structure S1 = F (type t = unit -> unit
                  val x = fn () => ())
structure S2 = F (type t = int
                  val x = 13)
val () = S1.get () ()
