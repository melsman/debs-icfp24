== Changes since <<Release20180207#,MLton 20180207>>

* Compiler.
  ** Added expert `-pi-style {default|npi|pic|pie}` and
  `-native-pic {false|true}` options, which can be used to override a
  target-determined default.
  ** Fix a number of instances of excessive live data during
  compilation.
  ** Disable `Zone` SSA optimization pass by default; the `Zone` pass
  is known to not be safe-for-space.
  ** Statically allocate and initialize some global objects.
  ** Many updates and improvements to C and LLVM codegens.
  ** Add new `BounceVars` RSSA optimization pass to split the live
  ranges of RSSA variables.
  ** Improve `RssaShrink` optimization.
  ** Add support for alternate globalization strategies in
  `ConstantPropagation`.
  ** Strengthen `Useless` optimization with respect to a number of
  primitives.
  ** Add new `DuplicateGlobals` and `SplitTypes` SSA optimization
  passes.
  ** Introduce new `Overflow`-checking primitives and remove old
  `Overflow`-checking primitives and special-case code required (e.g.,
  `Arith` transfers in IRs) to support them.
  ** Add parsers for XML, SXML, SSA, and SSA2 IRs.
* Runtime.
  ** Detect and report incompatible use of ASLR/PIE on `load-world`.
  ** Added support for RISC-V architecture.
* Language.
* Libraries.
  ** Basis Library.
    *** Change `OS.IO.poll` to not be restarted when interrupted by a
    signal.  (This is consistent with `Socket.select`.)
    *** Add `MLton.sizeAll: unit \-> IntInf.int` that returns the size
    of reachable live data.
    *** Change type of `MLton.size` from `'a \-> int` to
    `'a \-> IntInf.int`, because with 64-bit systems, the size of a
    single object can exceed that representable by a signed 32-bit
    integer.
  ** Other libraries.
    *** Updated: ckit library, MLLPT library, MLRISC library, SML/NJ library
* Tools.
* Other.
  ** Updates to simplify porting MLton.
  ** Support parallel build (i.e., `make -j`).  This mainly supports
  platforms/packagers that use a parallel `make` by default; it does
  not obtain significant build speedups.
  ** Various updates to `Makefile`-s.  See `Makefile.config` for
  common and user-customizable configuration.
  ** Characterize MLton-LICENSE as an instance of the Historical
  Permission Notice and Disclaimer (HPND) license, rather than
  BSD-style.
