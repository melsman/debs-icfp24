= MLton

MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for the Standard{nbsp}ML
programming language.  MLton generates small executables with
excellent runtime performance, utilizing untagged and unboxed native
integers, reals, and words, unboxed native arrays, fast
arbitrary-precision arithmetic based on GMP, and multiple code
generation and garbage collection strategies.  In addition, MLton
provides a feature rich Standard{nbsp}ML programming environment, with
full support for SML97 as given in The Definition of Standard{nbsp}ML
(Revised), a number of useful language extensions, a complete
implementation of the Standard ML Basis Library, various useful
libraries, a simple and fast C foreign function interface, the ML
Basis system for programming with source libraries, and tools such as
a lexer generator, a parser generator, and a profiler.
