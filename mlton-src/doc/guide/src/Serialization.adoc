= Serialization

<<StandardML#,Standard ML>> does not have built-in support for
serialization.  Here are papers that describe user-level approaches:

* <<References#Elsman04,Elsman04>>
* <<References#Kennedy04,Kennedy04>>

The MLton repository also contains an experimental generic programming
library (see
https://github.com/MLton/mltonlib/blob/master/com/ssh/generic/unstable/README[`README`]) that
includes a pickling (serialization) generic (see
https://github.com/MLton/mltonlib/blob/master/com/ssh/generic/unstable/public/value/pickle.sig[`pickle.sig`]).
