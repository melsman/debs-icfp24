* [[bug02]]
Bugs in `MLton.size` and `MLton.share`; calling `MLton.size` or `MLton.share`
with a non-pointer variant of an object type that could be represented by either
a pointer or a non-pointer (e.g., the `NONE` variant of an `int list option`)
would segfault.

* [[bug01]]
Latent bug in `MLton.GC.collect`; an explicit `MLton.GC.collect` call was passed
`0` bytes requested rather than the bytes required by the return block(s).
+
Fixed by commit https://github.com/MLton/mlton/commit/1f4daa14d[`1f4daa14d`].
