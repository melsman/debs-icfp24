= Performance

This page compares the performance of a number of SML compilers on a
range of benchmarks.

This page compares the following SML compiler versions.

* <<Home#,MLton>> 20171211 (git 79d4a623c)
* <<MLKit#,ML Kit>> 4.3.12 (20171210)
* <<MoscowML#,Moscow ML>> 2.10.1 `` (git f529b33bb, 20170711)
* <<PolyML#,Poly/ML>> 5.7.2 Testing (git 5.7.1-35-gcb73407a)
* <<SMLNJ#,SML/NJ>> 110.81 (20170501)

There are tables for <<#RunTime,run time>>, <<#CodeSize,code size>>, and
<<#CompileTime,compile time>>.


== Setup

All benchmarks were compiled and run on a 2.6 GHz Core i7-5600U with 16G of
RAM.  The benchmarks were compiled with the default settings for all
the compilers, except for Moscow ML, which was passed the
`-orthodox -standalone -toplevel` switches.  The Poly/ML executables
were produced using `polyc`.
The SML/NJ executables were produced by wrapping the entire program in
a `local` declaration whose body performs an `SMLofNJ.exportFn`.

For more details, or if you want to run the benchmarks yourself,
please see the https://github.com/MLton/mlton/tree/master/benchmark[`benchmark`] directory of our
<<Sources#>>.

All of the benchmarks are available for download from this page.  Some
of the benchmarks were obtained from the SML/NJ benchmark suite.  Some
of the benchmarks expect certain input files to exist in the
https://github.com/MLton/mlton/tree/master/benchmark/tests/DATA[`DATA`] subdirectory.

[#RunTime]
== Run-time ratio

The following table gives the ratio of the run time of each benchmark
when compiled by another compiler to the run time when compiled by
MLton.  That is, the larger the number, the slower the generated code
runs.  A number larger than one indicates that the corresponding
compiler produces code that runs more slowly than MLton.  A * in an
entry means the compiler failed to compile the benchmark or that the
benchmark failed to run.

[[SNFNote]]
Note: for SML/NJ, the
https://raw.github.com/MLton/mlton/master/benchmark/tests/smith-normal-form.sml[`smith-normal-form.sml`]
benchmark was killed after running for over 51,000 seconds.


[#CodeSize]
== Code size

The following table gives the code size of each benchmark in bytes.
The size for MLton and the ML Kit is the sum of text and data for the
standalone executable as reported by `size`.  The size for Moscow
ML is the size in bytes of the executable `a.out`.  The size for
Poly/ML is the difference in size of the database before the session
start and after the commit.  The size for SML/NJ is the size of the
heap file created by `exportFn` and does not include the size of
the SML/NJ runtime system (approximately 100K).  A * in an entry means
that the compiler failed to compile the benchmark.
