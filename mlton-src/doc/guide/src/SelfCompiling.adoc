= SelfCompiling

If you want to compile MLton, you must first get the <<Sources#>>. You
can compile with either MLton or SML/NJ, but we strongly recommend
using MLton, since it generates a much faster and more robust
executable.

== Compiling with MLton

To compile with MLton, you need the binary versions of `mlton`,
`mllex`, and `mlyacc` that come with the MLton binary package.  To be
safe, you should use the same version of MLton that you are building.
However, older versions may work, as long as they don't go back too
far.  To build MLton, run `make` from within the root directory of the
sources.  This will build MLton first with the already installed
binary version of MLton and will then rebuild MLton with itself.

First, the `Makefile` calls `mllex` and `mlyacc` to build the lexer
and parser, and then calls `mlton` to compile itself.  When making
MLton using another version the `Makefile` automatically uses
`mlton-stubs.mlb`, which will put in enough stubs to emulate the
`structure MLton`.  Once MLton is built, the `Makefile` will rebuild
MLton with itself, this time using `mlton.mlb` and the real
`structure MLton` from the <<BasisLibrary#,Basis Library>>.  This second round
of compilation is essential in order to achieve a fast and robust
MLton.

Compiling MLton requires at least 1GB of RAM for 32-bit platforms (2GB is
preferable) and at least 2GB RAM for 64-bit platforms (4GB is preferable).
If your machine has less RAM, self-compilation will
likely fail, or at least take a very long time due to paging.  Even if
you have enough memory, there simply may not be enough available, due
to memory consumed by other processes.  In this case, you may see an
`Out of memory` message, or self-compilation may become extremely
slow.  The only fix is to make sure that enough memory is available.

=== Possible Errors

* The C compiler may not be able to find the <<GMP#>> header file,
`gmp.h` leading to an error like the following.
+
----
  cenv.h:49:18: fatal error: gmp.h: No such file or directory
----
+
The solution is to install (or build) <<GMP#>> on your machine.  If you
install it at a location not on the default seach path, then run
``make WITH_GMP_INC_DIR=__/path/to/gmp/include__ WITH_GMP_LIB_DIR=__/path/to/gmp/lib__``.

* The following errors indicates that a binary version of MLton could
not be found in your path.
+
----
/bin/sh: mlton: command not found
----
+
----
make[2]: mlton: Command not found
----
+
You need to have `mlton` in your path to build MLton from source.
+
During the build process, there are various times that the `Makefile`-s
look for a `mlton` in your path and in `src/build/bin`.  It is OK if
the latter doesn't exist when the build starts; it is the target being
built.  Failure to find a `mlton` in your path will abort the build.


== Compiling with SML/NJ

To compile with SML/NJ, run `make bootstrap-smlnj` from within the
root directory of the sources.  You must use a recent version of
SML/NJ.  First, the `Makefile` calls `ml-lex` and `ml-yacc` to build
the lexer and parser.  Then, it calls SML/NJ with the appropriate
`sources.cm` file.  Once MLton is built with SML/NJ, the `Makefile`
will rebuild MLton with this SML/NJ built MLton and then will rebuild
MLton with the MLton built MLton.  Building with SML/NJ takes
significant time (particularly during the `parseAndElaborate` phase
when the SML/NJ built MLton is compiling MLton).  Unless you are doing
compiler development and need rapid recompilation, we recommend
compiling with MLton.
