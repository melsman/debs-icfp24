= Chunkify

<<Chunkify#>> is an analysis pass for the <<RSSA#>>
<<IntermediateLanguage#>>, invoked from <<ToMachine#>>.

== Description

It partitions all the labels (function and block) in an <<RSSA#>>
program into disjoint sets, referred to as chunks.

== Implementation

* https://github.com/MLton/mlton/blob/master/mlton/backend/chunkify.sig[`chunkify.sig`]
* https://github.com/MLton/mlton/blob/master/mlton/backend/chunkify.fun[`chunkify.fun`]

== Details and Notes

Breaking large <<RSSA#>> functions into chunks is necessary for
reasonable compile times with the <<CCodegen#>> and the <<LLVMCodegen#>>.
